# Write your code for the 'Transpose' exercise in this file. Make the tests in
# `transpose_test.rb` pass.

# To get started with TDD, see the `README.md` file in your
# `ruby/transpose` directory.

# what is given
# a string seperated by \n to denote rows

# what do we want
# a string where the rows have become the cols and the cols the rows

# caveat
# if the rows have diff lengths, then add the padding on the left

class Transpose
  def self.transpose(input)
    # take the input string and represent it as a matrix
    # take each line and as a row of strings
    # turn each line into individual chars

    # transpose
    # take the matrix and
  end
